# Unfiltered OAuth Server

A VERY SIMPLE example of an unfiltered oauth server. Use in conjunction with unfiltered oauth client

# usage

get and run the client

```
g8 unfiltered/unfiltered-oauth-client
cd unfiltered-oauth-client && sbt update run
```

get and run the server

```
g8 unfiltered/unfiltered-oauth-server
cd unfiltered-oauth-server && sbt update run
```

This server is preconfigured with an oauth consumer with an key set to `key` and password set to `secret`
